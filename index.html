    <h1>The Solar System</h1>
    <p>
      The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or
      indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder
      being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years
      ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's
      mass is in the Sun.

    <h1>The Planets</h1>
    <p>
      The eight planets of the Solar System are the large celestial bodies that orbit the Sun directly. The planets
      were thought by many early astronomers to be divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge
      advanced,
      their nature was explained in terms of physics and mechanics. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union
      officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial
      because it excludes many objects of mass based on where or what they orbit.

    <h1>The Sun</h1>
    <p>
      The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal
      convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of
      energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that
      of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's
      mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier
      elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.
